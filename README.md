# SynAshvins
*Digital Twins for NeuroTech.*

> The **Ashvins** are Hindu twin gods associated with medicine, health, and sciences. They are described as youthful divine twin horsemen, travelling in a chariot drawn by horses that are never weary, and portrayed as guardian deities that safeguard and rescue people by aiding them in various situations.

This repository provides tools to create a digital twin of the visual system of visually impaired people. Placed within a simulated naturalistic environment, a virtual agent learns to solve tasks given an encoded latent representation of visual stimuli that could e.g. represent phosphenes induced by a visual prosthesis. To achieve suitable representations and behavior, we apply Reinforcement Learning in an end-to-end fashion.
